		Welcome to the questlog. This site is dedicated to logging online gaming. 
		You can participate in a quest with any number of friends and it will be 
		archived online.
		<br /><br />
		The primary goal of the questlog was to allow roll playing with people who 
		do not have a lot of concentrated time, so it is designed to collect posts 
		over a long period. It is up to the gamemaster to keep the quest 
		cohesive, especially in the case of a large group of players.
