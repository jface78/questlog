I can't scroll down beyond the first few posts!</b><br /><br />You are probably on Chrome or Safari and are either zoomed in or zoomed out. You may also notice your quest posts have weirdwhite lines crisscrossing them. This is a bug with webkit-based browsers. Hit ctrl+ and/or ctrl- to fix the problem.<br /><br /><b>How do I roll dice?</b><br /><br />Two ways. The easiest is to use the dice roller tool accessible via the menu (click "Dice"). To roll directly into your quest log,you need to use a specific text command in the body of your post:<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><b><pre>/roll 1d20</pre></b></div>The above will simulate the rolling of a single 20-sided die. Once you submit your post, that text will be replaced with your die roll results. The roll can be modified by adding either an addition or subtraction operator after the roll command, like so:<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><b><pre>/roll 1d20+2/roll 1d20-4</pre></b></div>The amount and type of dice can be altered to virtually any combination. For example:<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><b><pre>/roll 5d3-2</pre></b></div>...is the equivalent to rolling 5 three-sided dice (LOL PARADOX?) and then subtracting 2 from the results. Note that once youmake a dice roll in-game, the results are not removable or editable in any way. This is to keep you honest. We all know you lied about all those natural 20s that one time.<br /><br />There must be a space between "/roll" and the dice you are rolling, and there must <b>not</b> be a space between any modifiersyou use (+ or -).<br /><br />Lastly, if you're in a huge hurry, you can use /r as shorthand for the /roll command.<br /><br /><b>Okay. Well, what about private messages?</b><br /><br />Much like the dice rolling explained above, questlog uses IRC-style commands to approximate private messages (PMs). The command syntax is:<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><b><pre>/msg [target] here is my private message!</pre></b></div>...where <b>target</b> is the name of the person you are messaging. The bracket characters ([ and ]) must surround the character's name.For example, if you want to send a PM to your co-player, Grognak the Barbarian, you'd do it like this:<br /><div style="text-align:center;"><b><pre>/msg [Grognak the Barbarian] I WILL SLAY YOU, COWARD!</pre></b></div>Private messages will extend until a new line is reached. So try not to send any novels. Spelling errors or typos in the name will result in messages not being sent. Sorry, princess, I can't do everything for you.<br /><br /><b>Who can see PMs?</b><br /><br />Just you and the recipient. Not the GM, not other players.<br /><br /><b>I see some quest logs with broken image tags or weird garbage characters in the text. What gives?</b><br /><br />QuestLog is an old codebase and has been through multiple iterations. Some of the database entries go back a decade so somestuff got messed up over the years.<br /><br /><b>No, I found something else broken and want to report it!</b><br /><br /><u><a href="#" onClick="javascript:spawnWindow(true, null, '50%', '50%', true, '0', '0', 'Report a Bug', 'static/reportabug.php', '#F0F0F0', false, false, true);">Report a bug.</a></u> <br /><br /><b>Alright then.</b><br /><br />Thank you for choosing QuestLog, citizen.<br /><br /></div></div>
