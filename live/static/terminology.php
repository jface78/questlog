The person in charge of your quest. The GM decides things like whether or not your thief is able to pick the fat nobleman's pocket, or if your old western sheriff succeeds in picking off the banditos over there. Usually there is some sort of dice roll involved in these decisions, but not always.<br /><br /><b>Players</b><br /><br />That one's pretty obvious. The other people who are participating in the quest, who are not GMs.<br /><br /><b>Quest</b><br /><br />The reason you are here. A play-by-post game involving two or more people. Like an internet forum but with more melodrama.<br /><br /><b>Post</b><br /><br />An entry in a quest. When you submit content to your quest, you are <i>posting</i> to it.<br /><br /><b>PM</b><br /><br />Private Message. Text shared between two players, for their eyes only.<br /><br /><b>1d20? 3d10? 80d6?</b><br /><br />Those are all dice rolls. In the common tongue of role-playing games, the standard way to textuallyrepresent a roll of the dice is: [amount of dice]d[type of dice]. Thus 1d20 represents one twenty-sided die, and3d6 would be three six-sided dice.<br /><br /><b>Potato</b><br /><br /><i>Solanum tuberosum,</i> a tuberous vegetable good for making whiskey and various other things that are probably good too.</div></div>
